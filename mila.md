# How to take care of Mila

## Daily Care Home

Mila is chill at home she doesn't do much, she we will walk to you usually if she wanted to go out or food, or if she wants attention.
Let the balcony doors open because likes the sun

For food and walking usually I do it: 
1. Start of the day 8-10 am 
2. Start of night 5-7 pm 
But it can be later if you are busy, just have to be twice a day

Food:
- Two servings of 125g of food, so 250g in total
  - There is a white balance close to the door of the kitchen
  - The food is in front of the fridge in the corner white bag.
  - It's ok if she eats once a day. 
  - Don't serve more food if she didn't eat anything before.
  - If you can't make the balance work, just cover the bowl bottom with food, it's almost the same as 125g


Water:
    - Always have the  water bowl full, change every 3 days.
    - She the water is to shallow she doesn't drink.

## Walking

Leash and poop bag:
- Mila has a anti-pull leash, simply but her head first and then cross bellow her arms and connect in the other side
- The leash should look like this

- The leash should be in front not in the back, that makes her not pull.
- There is poop bags in the black container on my corridor, take 3 just to be sure.

Walking time:
- Just let her walk, usually I walk 20-50 minutes but if you don't have time, let her pee in the yard in front of the house is ok.
- It's good for her to shit at least once a day.
- Is ok for her to eat grass, it's good for her stomach.
- She sometimes has trouble interacting with bigger or same size dogs, she doesn't bite ok but she barks, look at her back the fur will start to "spike", owners don't like.
- She is usually ok with small dogs.


## Other

Since she doesn't recognize you she will bark a lot in the beggining when you get home, just chill open the door let her smell you she will calm down eventually.
